    <p>
        An omelette (also spelled omelet) is a dish made from eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. 
        It is a common practice for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, 
        meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, onions or some combination of the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often 
        beaten with a small amount of milk, cream, or water.  
    </p>

    <p>
        A good omelet is a little bit fluffy, but firm enough to contain its filling. You cook an omelet by whisking 
        eggs with a bit of water or milk and cooking them quickly over high heat without stirring. You can then fold 
        the omelet in half to serve it. While the French word omelette was first used in the 1600s, the omelet itself may 
        be more than two hundred years older than that. The Latin root, lamella, means "thin plate."
