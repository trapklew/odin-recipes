    <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles (中華麺, chūkamen) 
        served in a broth; common flavors are soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including sliced 
        pork (chāshū), nori (dried seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), and scallions. Ramen has its roots 
        in Chinese noodle dishes.[1] Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, 
        such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido. </p>

    <p>Today, ramen is a cultural icon in Japan, with many regional varieties and a wide range of toppings. 
        Examples include Sapporo's rich miso ramen, Hakodate's salt-flavored ramen, Kitakata's thick, flat 
        noodles in pork-and-niboshi broth, Tokyo-style ramen with soy-flavored chicken broth, Yokohama's Iekei 
        Ramen with soy flavored pork broth, Wakayama's soy sauce and pork bone broth, and Hakata's milky tonkotsu 
        (pork bone) broth. Ramen is offered in various establishments and locations, with the best quality usually 
        found in specialist ramen shops called ramenya</p>
